## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes **routine malaria surveillance data** from Burkina Faso (2016–2023) to:  
- Assess malaria incidence trends at the **health district level**  
- Adjust incidence using WHO’s framework (testing, reporting, care-seeking)  
- Identify **key drivers of malaria transmission** (interventions & climate)  

The analysis combines **routine HMIS data**, **DHS/MIS surveys**, **PNLP intervention coverage**, and **CHIRPS rainfall data**.

## 📊 Data Sources  
- **HMIS (Health Management Information System):** malaria cases, 2016–2023  
- **PNLP (Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme):** ITN, SMC, stockouts  
- **DHS/MIS:** ITN ownership, treatment-seeking, IPTp coverage  
- **CHIRPS:** Rainfall estimates  

⚠️ **Note**: Routine & intervention data are **not public**. DHS/MIS & CHIRPS climate data are publicly available.

## Methods  

### Data Management  
- Standardized district & health facility names  
- Removed duplicates / inconsistencies  
- Classified facility reporting status (active vs inactive)  
- Detected & imputed outliers (3×SD, MAD, IQR methods)  

### Incidence Adjustments  
- **Crude incidence** = confirmed cases ÷ population × 1000  
- **Adjustment 1** = + testing completeness  
- **Adjustment 2** = + reporting completeness  
- **Adjustment 3** = + treatment-seeking rates  

### Trend Analysis  
- Seasonal-Trend decomposition (STL)  
- Sen’s slope (trend magnitude)  
- Mann-Kendall test (trend significance, α=0.05)  

### Drivers of Malaria Incidence  
- Generalized Additive Models (GAM)  
- Covariates: rainfall, ITN/SMC coverage, stockouts, treatment-seeking  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Adjustment 1 ≈ crude incidence** → effective testing policies  
- **Adjustment 2** revealed underreporting in East, Sahel, Centre-North, Centre-East  
- **Adjustment 3** added ~450 cases per 1000 in Gorom-Gorom, Gaoua, Kaya, Boussouma, Fada → care-seeking effect  
- 39/70 districts show **downward trends**, while Gorom-Gorom, Sapone, Kampti show **persistent increases**
